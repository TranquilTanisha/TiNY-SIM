<h1>TiNY SIM (Steganography Based Image Manipulation)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message, file, image, or video within another message, file, image, or video. The goal of steganography is to hide the existence of the secret data, making it difficult for an observer to detect or extract the concealed information.

The project performs encoding and decoding on files using <strong>Huffman encoding</strong> for lossless data compression.
