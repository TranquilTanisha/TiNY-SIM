<h1>TiNY SIM (Steganography Based Image Manipulation)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Steganography is the practice of hiding information within another medium, such as text, images, audio, or video files, in a way that conceals the existence of the hidden data. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable without a key, steganography embeds the data in a way that it remains undetectable to casual observers. Steganography is often used for secure communication, watermarking, and digital rights management.

The project performs encoding and decoding on files using <strong>Huffman encoding</strong> for lossless compression of data. 
<h2>Tech Stack:</h2>
<ul>
  <p><strong>Backend: </strong>Python/Django and OpenCV</p>
  <p><strong>Frontend: </strong>HTML, CSS and JS</p>
  <p><strong>Database: </strong>SQLite</p>
</ul>

<h2>Uses: </h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> It allows covert communication by embedding messages within ordinary files, making the existence of the message itself hidden.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Watermarking: </strong>It is used to embed copyright information or ownership details within digital media (images, audio, video) to protect intellectual property.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidential Data Storage: </strong>Sensitive information can be hidden within other files on a device, reducing the likelihood of detection during unauthorized access.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to run?</h2>
Go to the terminal, inside the main folder, simply write <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>
